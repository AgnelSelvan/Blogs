# Asymptotic Notation

* The effiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other things required to execute the algo.
* The algo will not have the same o/p for different input value provided.
* It depends on the size of the input based on that the performance will change.
* The study of change in the performance of the algo based o the input size is known as **Asymptotic Analysis**

### WHat is Asymptotic Notation?
* Asymptotic Notation is noting but a mathamatical notation are used to describe a running time of a algorithm
* Running time of the algorithm depends in the Input value.
* There are three main types of notation:
    * Big-O notation (O(n)).
    * Omega notation 
    * Theta notation
